# Snake game

This is a classic Snake game like the one you played in a Nokia.
Just like the [dice game](https://github.com/jbbenavidesr/diceGame). I am following
a tutorial in [Scrimba's](https://scrimba.com) frontend developer path. However,
I'm not just following the tutorial, I watched completely without writing a single
line of code and afterwards I developed the game from scratch.

The idea is that the tutorial gave me an idea of how should it be done, but now
I'll start the process from the planning stage, so I'll probably end up with a
solution that differs from that in the tutorial, though it'll probably have the
same basic idea behind.
